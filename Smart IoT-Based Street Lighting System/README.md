# 💡 Smart IoT-Based Street Lighting System  
### Internet of Things – Individual Assignment

This project proposes a **Smart IoT Street Lighting System** designed to solve real-world safety, energy, and sustainability challenges.  

The system uses IoT sensors, microcontrollers, wireless communication, and solar technology to intelligently control street lights based on **visibility**, **weather**, **motion**, and **traffic conditions**.

---

## 🌍 Problem Background
Traditional street lighting relies on fixed schedules and consumes large amounts of energy, while failing to adapt to changing conditions such as:
- Poor visibility (fog, haze, rain)
- Low traffic during late hours
- High accident risk in dark areas
- Manual or slow fault detection
- High maintenance and energy cost

This assignment explores how IoT can transform street lighting into a **smart, responsive, and efficient system**.
